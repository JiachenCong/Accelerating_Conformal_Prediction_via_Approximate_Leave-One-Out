# Accelerating_Conformal_Prediction_via_Approximate_Leave-One-Out
Code for the numerical experiments section of the paper ''Accelerating Conformal Prediction via Approximate Leave-One-Out''.


The simulation folder contains MATLAB scripts corresponding to the Synthetic data section of the paper.

All scripts are fully self-contained and can be directly executed in MATLAB without additional dependencies.
Each file represents one specific simulation setting discussed in the paper.

File Descriptions:

simulationjkpluslambda01.m
Simulation code for Jackknife+ and Fast Jackknife+ when 位 = 0.1.

simulationjkpluslambda1.m
Simulation code for Jackknife+ and Fast Jackknife+ when 位 = 1.

simulationjkminmaxlambda01.m
Simulation code for Jackknife-minmax and Fast Jackknife-minmax when 位 = 0.1.

simulationjkminmaxlambda1.m
Simulation code for Jackknife-minmax and Fast Jackknife-minmax when 位 = 1.

Usage:
Simply open any .m file in MATLAB and run it.
Each script will automatically generate the results corresponding to the numerical experiments described in the paper.

In the real data folder.
